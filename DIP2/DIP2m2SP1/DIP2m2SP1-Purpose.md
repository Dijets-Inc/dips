## DIP2m2SP1 Purpose Description:

The amendment is proposed to introduce Monthly Meetings schedule in [DIP1m1: Governance Cycle Breakdown](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dips/blob/master/DIP1/dip1.md#dip1m1-governance-cycle-breakdown)
The reason behind this proposal is to provide a structure of communication between the DGC. Whilst the ability to communicate virtually is accessible now, more than ever. The benefits of face to face meetings cannot always be replicated. As we are in the early stages of Dijets, bouncing ideas off one another and ensuring that we are all of the same understanding will be beneficial to the way in which the Council grows.
